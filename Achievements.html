							<p>During my schooling days, I had the honour to go under rigorous test and face interviews by one of the best in Media Industry resulting in me being a part of 25 student cohort across the country which became a part of Times Of India, Junior Editorial Board. Also, I won the Inter-District Debate competition held at Presidency School, Bhiwandi for a record consecutive 3 times from 2012-2014. Apart from various Debates and Elocution competitions, I was also active in Quizzing and held various Positions of Responsibility throughout my schooling.</p>
							<p>During my Engineering days, I was among the top 200 students of the country to be conferred upon with the Google India Scholarship for pursuing Android Development. This propelled me to take up the certification and be a Google Certified Associate Android Developer. Apart from buliding apps for fun, I also did some side gigs in Digital Marketing and Google Analytics. An NPTEL Gold Medallist in Communication Skills, 32nd in Thane Talent Search Examination, 5th in Maharashtra in Essay Writing Competition and a Honours certificate from University of Illinois from Marketing Management are some of my other achievements up to date.</p>
